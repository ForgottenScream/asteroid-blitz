# Asteroid Blitz

Guided project from Boot.dev, the aim is to gain experience with creating and managing a python project with multiple files, plus creating a cool classic game.

Some of the maths in the project were pre-written by Boot.dev so I cannot take credit, I included in the commit description when that applies.
